# Collectors' Tune Tracker (CTT)

* [Github **Pages* Site](https://adron.github.io/collectorstunetracker/)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/Adron/collectorstunetracker)

The idea behind the CTT is to serve several key larger picture ideas behind enjoying, collecting, and learning about music, artists, performers, writers, and related persuits.

1. Provide a simple interface to look up music, musicians, artists, performers, writers, and related people involved in the community/industry.
2. Provide a way to provide updates and additions manually.
3. Provide a way to map additional correlations between music, musicians, artists, performers, and writers. Based around the idea of being able to research multiple depths of information about a particular music, musician, artist, performer, or writer along with history, events, and related information about said music.
4. Provide a way to retrieve information in an automated way from other systems (like CDDB for example, more thoughts on this [here](https://github.com/Adron/collectorstunetracker/issues/4)).

More details to come...  April 4th, 2024.
